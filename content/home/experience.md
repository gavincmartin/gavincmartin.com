  description = """
  I interned with the Mission Planning team on NASA's flagship Europa Clipper
  mission and specifically worked on improving their modeling and simulation software.
  
  My focus started with optimizing modules where possible to improve speed, scalability, and reliability,
  and I eventually automated the MP team's workflow, piecing together mission simulation tools,
  downstream analysis software, and data delivery processes using Jenkins and Docker. The work
  streamlined mission planning, made it easier to iterate quickly, and enabled a shift towards
  cloud-based computing resources.
  
  I also used simulation software outputs, Google Earth, and Python to build a dynamic and interactive 3D
  visualization tool for science instrument coverage maps of Europa's surface. The software gives
  mission planners and science teams the ability to intuitively see how each instrument's 
  resolution and coverage build up over time.

  I served as the Project Manager for the Seeker Vision project--an effort to
  endow NASA JSC's Seeker-1 CubeSat with "intelligent" vision capabilities.

  Our team adapted state-of-the-art convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures
  to the space environment and trained them to detect, recognize, and provide
  relative bearing estimates for a target spacecraft (Cygnus) while in orbit.
  We used the TensorFlow Object Detection API and OpenCV to write flight software
  that is resilient to varied vehicle orientations, lighting conditions, and backdrops
  and is capable of running on a low-powered CubeSat flight computer.

  Our computer vision system was integrated onto the flight unit and will be
  validated in space. **Seeker-1 launched on Cygnus NG-11 in April 2019 and
  will be deployed from the ISS in Summer 2019**.

  location = "Austin, Texas"
  date_start = "2017-03-01"
  date_end = "2017-11-01"
  description = """
  I helped revive the Texas Spacecraft Laboratory after over a year of dormancy,
  and I served as its first student leader. I also managed its ARMADILLO mission: a
  CubeSat funded by the Air Force Research Laboratory that had been built by a
  previous generation of UT students who had long since graduated.

  My managerial role primarily consisted of recruiting and training new students,
  integrating communication and project management platforms, and providing lab-wide direction.
  In the process, we scaled the laboratory from a core group of 5 novice undergraduates to over 50 skilled
  engineers. We built up the TSL nearly from scratch, and as we grew, brought in
  exciting new projects.

  Since ARMADILLO was already built when I took on the role, my technical responsibilities
  were primarily focused on testing and operations. I designed and performed extensive spacecraft
  hardware testing with Air Force engineers to prove that the spacecraft was operationally ready.
  I then worked with our team to construct an operations infrastructure capable of supporting
  the spacecraft once it reached orbit. This consisted of overhauling our ground station
  for satellite tracking and communication, developing robust real-time operations software,
  creating operations plans and procedures, and training students to operate ARMADILLO.
  Our efforts culminated in a successful Ground Operations Readiness Review and a green
  light for launch. **ARMADILLO will launch on a SpaceX Falcon Heavy in 2019 (STP-2)**.

  description = """
  I worked as an intern at GE Aviation in one of their composites manufacturing facilities,
  and I split my time between software and industrial engineering.

  I started by value-stream mapping the facility's growing repair division, helping to discover
  hidden bottlenecks and identify areas for efficiency improvement. My early findings indicated
  that communication and software limitations stalled progress, prolonged turnaround
  time, and frustrated customers.
  
  As a result, I spent the rest of my summer developing custom enterprise resource planning
  software to address these deficincies. My comprehensive program integrated product tracking and communications
  across shipping and receiving, engineers, repair technicians, and customer service representatives. I also
  automated much of the customer service reporting, freeing up valuable company time and improving
  customer satisfaction. The software ultimately streamlined the flow of information throughout the division.
