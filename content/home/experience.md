  In my current role, I work on the Constellation Operations team for Project Kuiper. I build mission operations tooling for a variety of planning, execution, and automation use cases so that we can successfully operate our satellites as we scale the constellation.

  As a precursor to on-orbit operations, I've also been heavily involved in hardware-in-the-loop testing of our flatsats and actual satellites on the ground. On our team, we have built test frameworks for running lower-level functional tests all the way up to high-level integration tests which exercise key concepts of operations, and we've built out automated reporting pipelines and dashboards using AWS services to drive progress in cross-program test campaigns.

  During my stint as a Software Systems Engineer at JPL, I led activity planning software development for the Europa Clipper mission, and I scaled my original team (see below) of 4 to 10 engineers over 2 years.

  We designed next-generation planning systems to support distributed spacecraft operations at institutions across the U.S. We aimed to model highly-complex systems, check system constraints, intelligently schedule ground & spacecraft behaviors, and empower operators to make effective decisions which preserve spacecraft safety while maximizing scientific output.

  I served as a representative for the Europa Clipper mission on a multi-mission software development team and collaborated on a Java framework for spacecraft activity planning and mission simulation. Specifically, I focused on designing the spacecraft modeling components of the framework and in developing a discrete event simulation engine to drive simulations.

  I served as the Project Manager for the Seeker Vision project--an effort to
  endow NASA JSC's Seeker-1 CubeSat with "intelligent" vision capabilities.

  Our team adapted state-of-the-art convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures
  to the space environment and trained them to detect, recognize, and provide
  relative bearing estimates for a target spacecraft (Cygnus) while in orbit.
  We used the TensorFlow Object Detection API and OpenCV to write flight software
  that was resilient to varied vehicle orientations, lighting conditions, and backdrops
  and was capable of running on a low-powered CubeSat flight computer.

  Our computer vision system was integrated onto the flight unit and was actually used for proximity operations in space. **Seeker-1 launched on Cygnus NG-11 in April 2019 and was deployed after a Cygnus re-supply in September 2019**.
