I’m an undergraduate student at UT-Austin who is interested in applying software to tough technical problems. Whether it’s automating mission planning for deep space explorers, giving satellites the ability to *see*, or streamlining composites manufacturing, I love attacking new challenges in high-stakes environments.

I’m passionate about using software to inform effective decision-making or take humans out-of-the-loop altogether, letting teams, businesses, and missions move quickly and with the information they need.
